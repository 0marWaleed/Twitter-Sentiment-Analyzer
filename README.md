# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## 📋 Project Description
This project analyzes Twitter data to classify tweets into different emotional categories using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The system processes raw tweet data, cleans and prepares the text, and builds models that can automatically detect emotions in social media content.

## 🎯 What It Does
- 🧹 Processes and cleans raw Twitter data
- 📝 Extracts meaningful text from tweets
- 😊 Classifies emotions into six categories: happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, and surprise
- 🤖 Uses machine learning to automatically detect emotions from text

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleans tweet text by removing mentions, numbers, and special characters
2. **Text Processing**: Tokenizes words and reduces them to their base forms
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features for analysis
4. **Model Training**: Uses machine learning algorithms to learn patterns in emotional content
5. **Classification**: Predicts emotional categories for new tweet text

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Regular expressions for text cleaning

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Install required libraries: `pandas nltk scikit-learn`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to process data and train models
3. Use the trained model to classify new tweet data

## 📊 Results
The project successfully demonstrates how to process social media text and build effective models for emotion classification, showing practical application of NLP techniques for understanding emotional content in short text messages.
